# 📋 StoryWeave Chronicles – Project TODO List (October 15, 2025)

## ✅ Completed & Stable
- Newsletter feature added
- Export/import bookmarks implemented
- Carousel mobile issues fixed (desktop/mobile both usable, needs polish)
- Database migrated to Neon (persistent, fast cover loading)
- Cover caching system optimized and stress tested
- RAM usage optimized (open to further improvements)
- Made a new cover system for the sake of being super optimized. (way faster and using way less memory if you can get over the first dry launch)
- managed to finally clean up and organize my back end. (will do the same for the front end once its completely stable)
- finally i can consider covers done on render. the download and everything works like a dream. i think it can handle 100 users no problem.
- fixed infinite polling with yet ANOTHER cover system. but this one is not only working, but is the most stable and the most optimized.
- FINALLY fixed the routing issue. no more!
- moved the schedules and mail to google cloud (and having uploads/updates automatically send out notifications and update the database)
- for advertising: adsterra implemented. now the website has ads. 

---

## ☐ Remaining Bugs & Improvements
- Carousel UI: polish for desktop and mobile
- churn is back. it fixed itself for a bit and now its back. (doesn't do TOO much damage, but still annoying)
- finish CI/CD make actually useful tests that need to be passed for dev to merge with main

---

## 🚀 Future Goals
- Continue monitoring and optimizing RAM/CPU usage
- Add admin tools: logs, rate limiting, restore deleted content, user activity overview
- Set up automated alerts for memory, queue length, error rates
- Consider service workers for offline access
- General UI polish and performance enhancements
- Username changes (stretch goal, not prioritized)
- cleanup and organize front end

---
## Deployment Constraints

- **Render Free Tier:**  
  - 256 MB RAM, 0.1 CPU, 100 connections per instance.
  - 750 free instance hours/month.
  - Services spin down after 15 minutes inactivity.
  - PostgreSQL: 1GB, expires every 30 days (moved to neon, no need to worry about this).
---

**Summary:**
Most major features and optimizations are complete. Focus now shifts to bug fixes, UI polish, admin tools, and ongoing performance improvements. Let me know which item you want to tackle next!

for definition so that we are on the same page: i am defining churn as = if the site deletes needed covers and then redownloads them wasting resources and time.
so with my react site, i have an atlas and a folder full of covers. the image name is the <cover id>.jpg. for some reason, it will do a comparison on the landing page list
remove covers that are in the folder believing it doesn't need them, realizes it DOES need those covers, and will redownload them. that is a churn to me.
if it were to delete, redownload, delete, redownload, that is 2 churns.

with definitions out of the way, i have had a churn problem every time i refresh the landing page. i can get all covers up and running perfectly. if i refresh to test,
the site for some reason deletes 10 covers saying they are not valid cause they dont exist. it then redownloads new versions. this is using up resources i can be putting
towards something else. remember i am deployed on render.com free tier. that doesn't give me a lot of resources to work with. so i need to make things as efficient and 
optimized as possible. which is why i want this churn gone!

(for memories sake:
- **Render Free Tier:**  
  - 256 MB RAM, 0.1 CPU, 100 connections per instance.
  - 750 free instance hours/month.
  - Services spin down after 15 minutes inactivity.
  - PostgreSQL: 1GB, expires every 30 days.)

no thanks just wanted to get you caught up to speed. so i just spent time cleaning up the backend and making it compatable with flask-restx so i can have my won openapi page. i did this because im setting up my CI/CD with help from github actions. the new setup im trying to have is local testing (what we are doing now) then a dev branch that goes live on render where i can test things in a live environment without worry. and then a production branch on github and render that users actually use. that way i can test and make new features. and if i break something the site isnt down for all users. i created another site specifically for dev on render. made a new branch called dev and connected it with render. made new branch rules so that you HAVE to pull request and pull requests HAVE to be approved to push changes from dev to prod. i also wanted to set up environments that dev has to pass before github will even let you make a pull request. one of those was a node tester (honestly thats how i found out that my current set up is only compatable with node 20 and onwards.) and now i want a way to be able to check the api to make sure they are robust and secure before we throw whatever new endpoints we make into prod. i found a github action for mayhem api. I created a mayhem account and as you just saw, i have refactored my entire flask app to be compatable and make an openapi page that mayhem can test against for security purposes. thats where we are at right now. that is the current state of the site right now.

Thanks for sharing the detailed context! Here's how we can proceed based on the outlined plan:

---

### **Action Plan**
1. **Prioritize Gmail API Integration**:
   - Replace the `send_scheduled_emails` function with Gmail API logic.
   - Remove Flask-Mail and related .env variables.

2. **Update Google Drive Webhook**:
   - Extend the `/api/drive-webhook` endpoint to handle:
     - Adding new books to the database.
     - Updating existing books.
     - Sending notifications for new/updated books.

3. **Remove Redundant Code**:
   - Delete the `/api/seed-drive-books` endpoint.
   - Remove the `check_and_notify_new_books` and `call_seed_drive_books` scheduled jobs.
   - Clean up .env variables related to the old email system and redundant jobs.

4. **Set Up Google Cloud Scheduler**:
   - Migrate the daily/weekly/monthly email jobs to Google Cloud Scheduler.

---

### **Next Steps**
Let me know which part you'd like to prioritize:
1. **Gmail API Integration**: Start with replacing the email-sending logic.
2. **Webhook Updates**: Focus on extending the `/api/drive-webhook` functionality.
3. **Code Cleanup**: Remove unused endpoints, jobs, and .env variables.

Alternatively, I can begin with the Gmail API integration and proceed sequentially. Let me know!

### Summary of Work Done and Next Steps

#### **Objective**
The goal is to transition the backend of Storyweave Chronicles to use Google Cloud services for email notifications and webhooks, ensuring reliability even when the backend spins down on Render.com. This includes testing the new integrations, cleaning up unused code, and preparing the site for launch.

---

#### **Completed Work**
1. **Google Cloud Webhook Integration**:
   - Verified that the `/api/drive-webhook` endpoint works correctly.
   - Confirmed no additional authentication is required for the webhook in Postman.

2. **Scheduled Email Notifications**:
   - Updated the `TestSendScheduledNotifications` endpoint to simulate sending scheduled notification emails in batches.
   - Added validation for frequency (`daily`, `weekly`, `monthly`) and logic to process users in batches with a delay between batches.

3. **Testing Plan**:
   - Provided Postman configurations for testing the updated `TestSendScheduledNotifications` endpoint.

---

#### **Current Status**
- The `TestSendScheduledNotifications` endpoint is ready for testing.
- The webhook functionality has been confirmed to work.
- The next steps involve testing the scheduled notifications and cleaning up unused variables and endpoints.

---

#### **Next Steps**
1. **Test Scheduled Notifications**:
   - Use Postman to test the `TestSendScheduledNotifications` endpoint with various frequencies and batch sizes.
   - Verify that emails are sent correctly and logs show expected behavior.

2. **Clean Up Unused Code**:
   - After confirming functionality, remove unused environment variables and endpoints related to the old email system.

3. **Implement Advertisements**:
   - Add advertisement functionality to the site, ensuring it integrates seamlessly with the existing design.

4. **Prepare for Launch**:
   - Finalize all features, test thoroughly, and prepare the site for public launch.

5. **Post-Launch Maintenance**:
   - Address any bugs or issues that arise post-launch and maintain the site.
